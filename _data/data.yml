# Profile
profile: |
  A highly skilled and detail-oriented statistician with a strong foundation 
  in programming and data structure. Proficient in statistical analysis, data modeling, 
  and machine learning techniques, and skilled in programming languages including R, Python, 
  and SQL. Proven ability to develop algorithms and implement statistical models 
  to solve complex problems. Strong communication and collaboration skills, 
  with experience working in cross-functional teams. Seeking a challenging role 
  that leverages my statistical and programming expertise to drive business results and innovation

# Experience
experience:
  - role: Teaching and Research Assistant
    time: 2022.1-2022.12
    company: University of Arizona
    details: |
      As a teaching assistant, I provided essential support to students in courses such as 
      Introduction to Function, Introduction to Statistics, and Introduction to Applied Regression 
      and Generalized Linear Models. I graded homework assignments and exams, 
      answered student questions during lectures, and held weekly office hours and exam review sessions. 
      As a research assistant, I gained hands-on experience in setting up and managing 
      a high-performance computing (HPC) environment for academic research. I used Singularity 
      to create containers on HPC and developed shell scripts to improve data processing efficiency. 
      Through my experience as both a teaching and research assistant, 
      I have developed strong communication and collaboration skills, as well as a passion for 
      solving complex problems through data analysis.
    technologies_used: | 
      R, Shell

  - role: Entry-level Software Engineer
    time: 2020.9-2021.5
    company: Jinmu Pulse Health Technology Co., Ltd. 
    details: |
      As an entry-level backend engineer, I collaborated with frontend engineers in the development 
      of a mobile application that analyzed users' pulses to provide medical suggestions. 
      I contributed to the design of the application's APIs and implemented and tested them using Golang. 
      My experience with both SQL/relational databases (such as MySQL) and NoSQL databases 
      (such as Redis) allowed me to effectively manage and manipulate data. Through this experience, 
      I developed a strong habit of clean and efficient coding and thorough documentation.

projects:
  - title: House Price Prediction
    link: House_Price.html
    details: |
      As part of my data science journey, I took on the Kaggle project House Price Prediction, 
      where I applied various regression algorithms such as random forest, lasso, ridge regression, 
      XGBoost, and ensemble method to the analysis. Through careful feature engineering and model tuning, 
      I was able to achieve accurate and reliable predictions on the dataset. 
      This project sharpened my skills in data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, 
      and ensemble techniques.

  - title: Prediction on Readmissions of Diabetic Patients
    link: readmission_using_pipeline.html
    details: |
      As part of a project on predicting readmission of diabetic patients, 
      I gained hands-on experience using Jupiter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, 
      and scikit-learn packages for data preprocessing and analysis. 
      I applied various classification algorithms, 
      including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, to solve the problem. 
      This project allowed me to develop skills in data analysis and problem-solving, 
      which I believe will be valuable in my future work.
